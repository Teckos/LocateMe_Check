# LocateMe_Check
Simple app I developped early 2015 that checks an IMEI on the Apple website to see if the device is locked with an account or not. Thatâ€™s something you can usually check when the device functions properly. But when the screen is broken, that information is no longer easy to get. Back then there were online paid services.
With that free app I provided to my customer (insurance company), his techs were able to check full batches of devices and know beforehand what to do (repair, replace, refuse).
